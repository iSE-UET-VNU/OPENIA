## Introduction

In this paper, we introduce OPENIA, a novel white-box (open-box) framework that leverages these internal representations to assess the correctness of LLM-generated code. By systematically analyzing the intermediate states of representative open-source code LLMs, including DeepSeek-Coder, Code Llama, and Magicoder, across diverse code generation benchmarks, we found that these internal representations encode latent information, which strongly correlates with the correctness
of the generated code. 

Our results show that OPENIA consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Scores with up to a 2X improvement in standalone code generation and a 3X enhancement in repository-specific scenarios. By unlocking the potential of in-process signals, OPENIA paves the way for more proactive and efficient quality assurance mechanisms in LLM-assisted code generation.

## Prepare Environment
First, we should set up a python environment. This code base has been tested under python 3.8.

```bash
$ conda create -n openia python=3.8
$ conda activate openia
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
